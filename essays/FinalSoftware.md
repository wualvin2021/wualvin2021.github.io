<h1></h1>

  <p>My journey in learning software engineering is over but it hasn't ended. I've learned so much not only in programming but also in real-world issues. On the programming side, there were three new languages to learn not including <i>React</i> and <i>Meteor</i> since they're kind of similar, but Javascript, HTML, and CSS were all very fun and rewarding. That's not to say all was sunshine and rainbows.</p>
  
  <p>Initially going in I was very skeptical, I didn't want to be a software engineer and I really did believe that it was not for me. I was also very much expecting this to be very difficult, after all learning 3 different programming languages in a semester seems very tough but luckily I can now say I was all wrong.</p>

<h1>Bugging my peers to fix bugs</h1>

 <p>One thing I'm most proud in this journey is making new friends and being more confident as an individual. Working together is very important, especially in a software engineering environment. Learning all these new concepts were made easier because of my friends and I can't thank them enough. The same is also said with my professors since they're the ones that actually did the teaching.  </p>
