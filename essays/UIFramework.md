<h1>Style for my File</h1> <img width ="200px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../img/Bootstrap_logo.png">

  <p>I've spent this week getting accustomed to frameworks for web design. I'll say upfront it's very difficult. It's also very tedious as when you have to match your opening tags with the closing tags your code will pile onto 100 lines very quickly. What's even more crazy is that most of the lines of code will only have one word on it. I get that frameworks like Bootstrap are supposed to help you but there will be times where I implement a navbar only from it to be off center or the wrong size I end up spending too much time fixing something that should have already been "correct" from the start.</p>

  <h2>History doesn't Repeat Itself, It Rhymes</h2>
  <p>When I was a freshman learning Java all those years ago, I didn't have a set of coding standards with the exception of the check style system that even I widely ignored. At that time I was more concerned about getting the correct answer and then styling later or in many cases, never. Anyway, once I finished my assignments, when I would look back at the code I wrote I would not understand what I wrote sometimes. This was terrible when it came to studying for tests or studying in general. Looking back at it now, I do believe I wasted a lot of time relearning stuff that would have never happened if I styled properly. Now we come full circle.</p>

   <h3>Artificial Intelligence for IntelliJ</h3>
  <p>Learning Javascript is no different when it comes to having Coding Standards. In this case, I got to experience IntelliJ and ESLint. IntelliJ is IDE and ESLint is like a form of checkstyle system I mentioned before but this time unlike when I learned Java they're errors instead of warnings. I also want to mention when I program on IntelliJ it'll tell me what I just wrote. In the example below, the ": number[]" was not written by me. it's either IntelliJ or ESLint and I'm willing to bet it's probably one of the inspections from IntelliJ with Javascript. It was annoying at first but then you realize with proper coding style you can even make your IDE understand what you're doing. If that's the case, then you definitely did something correctly.</p>

```javascript
const testNums : number[] =  [1, 2, 3, 4];  
```
