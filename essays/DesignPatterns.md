<h1>Pattern Practices</h1> 
<img width ="300px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../img/design-patterns.png">
  <p>My main understanding of design patterns is that it's a concept that uses templates to solve problems. Many of these solutions however have pros and cons. Something that requires a bit of intuition from the programmer. The best example I've heard was the global variable problem in languages that don't like global variables. The solution to this problem is the singleton solution, a class that only has one instance. I like to believe this is what <i>React</i> and <i>Meteor</i> is meant for. The idea of having a package of three seperate languages in one is very useful and convenient.</p>

  <h2>Refining my designs</h2>
  <p>My initial understanding was something totally different, I thought it was like Bootstrap where you add style to your software, and boom, you got a killer site. I was wrong. Even React and Meteor was very new to me. After learning more I now understand it for what it is. But no, I've never actively sought out design patterns for my work. I've mainly just used whatever is easiest to write. Going forward, I'll keep in mind the many design patterns that may be out there. Maybe I could create my own.</p>
