### I. Introduction
AI is very interesting, to say the least. It even feels like you are talking to a real person if you are using a Chatbot feature. Without a doubt, AI will be the future in this world. Despite the   

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18: I've never had to use AI because I felt that there were already enough resources given to me to succeed. 

  3. In-class Practice WODs: I've only used AI once or twice and that was when I didn't have a partner or was doing self practice. Most In-class WODs were with a partner so I.

  4. In-class WODs: I have used AI for almost all of these as the time limit for me was quite stressful. For the first Morning Brew WOD that we needed to make completely from scratch with HTML and CSS, I used ChatGPT and Co-pilot to make sure that I wouldn't have to stare at code when it was broken. 

  5. Essays: I did not use AI for this because I felt that Essays had to feel "human".

  6. Final project: a few times, Mainly for concepts like Javascript underscore or other backend components. It didn't really help with ESlint errors  

  7. Learning a concept/tutorial: A few amount of times, prior to ICS 314 I had very little experience with javascript so I has AI explain what a line meant.  

  8. Answering a question in class or in Discord: I did not use AI for this. 

  9. Asking or answering a smart-question: I did not use AI for this. 

  10. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”: I would not use AI to give me an example rather instead give me to answer to a problem. 

  11. Explaining code: I've had AI used a few times and this kind of goes hand in hand with point #7 when I was learning something completely new I would ask AI to explain what each line means.

  12. Writing code: I have used plugins like Github Co-pilot to give me suggestions, like how my professors have said it's about 70% correct.  

  13. Documenting code: I did not use AI for this as I was unaware it had this kind of feature. 

  14. Quality assurance: I use this the most and this is probably where I had the most amount of success with AI. Most times it would be after I "finished" and then run it through to check. It was just fixing/cleaning up any bugs that may take someone a good amount of minutes even with a good eye.

  15. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above: Every use of AI I have listed above.


### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:


### IV. Practical Applications:


### V. Challenges and Opportunities:
As I said in my intro, I do believe that AI will be our future whether we like it or not. Personally, I am a little more on the worried side than the confident side only because it has a possibility to take my job.  

### VI. Comparative Analysis:


### VII. Future Considerations:


### VIII. Conclusion:
