<h1> The Art In Smart Questions</h1>

  <p>I was browsing on <i>Stack Overflow</i> for reasons of self-improvement and as I was lurking around I discovered something quite interesting, and I wish to share my experiences with all of you. For those unaware, <i>Stack Overflow</i> is a forums-like website that lets programmers "ask" questions to other programmers. the reason I quoted the word ask was because it's a page where anyone can ask questions and that means there will be both good and bad questions </p>
