A web application that allows users to sign up and buddy up with someone to go to the gym.    

<hr>


<p>This was a group project consisting of 6 software engineering students. </p>

<p>As someone who doesn't go to the gym because of "gymtimidation" I only like to go to the gym if I have a friend. This was the reason this website was built because just like me, many others have the same fear but we still want to work out for various reasons.</p>
