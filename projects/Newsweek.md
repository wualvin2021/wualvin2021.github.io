Newsweek clone is just that, a clone of the popular news media "Newsweek." The point of the project was to get familiarized with responsive CSS, so if you're viewing this on mobile or on a smaller window you would see that as the screen gets smaller the website would readjust itself. This project also incorporates Bootstrap for added styles.
