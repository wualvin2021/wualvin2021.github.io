A simple Apple website using HTML and CSS. Features clickable links and images.   

<hr>


This was my first project using only HTML and CSS. The goal was to replicate an old Apple Website. I created this project when I was first learning about HTML and CSS. I used images you would see on an actual Apple Website. The website itself is formatted very similarly to an actual Apple website. The layout itself contains a navbar, the black bar on top that simulates a navigation bar the images themselves are clickable links. The hero and sub-hero sections showcase the different Apple products. Finally, the footer section mimics the different navigation links at the bottom of the page.
