A simple Apple website using HTML and CSS. Features clickable links and images.

<pre>
This was my first project using only HTML and CSS. The goal was to replicate an old Apple Website. I created this project when I was first learning about HTML and CSS. I used images you would see on an actual Apple Website. The website itself is formatted very similarly to an actual Apple website. The layout itself contains a navbar, this is the black bar on top that simulates a navigation bar.
